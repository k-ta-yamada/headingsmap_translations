# Headingsmap Translations

This repository is meant to be the place to have the translations of the texts and labels that the extension has. The
texts are divided in two groups:
* Translations that are added programmatically. They are labels that are in json files under the directory "_locales".
* HTML contents that are static. They are HTML files that are located in different folders under the directory "html".

So far there are four language versions (English, French, Spanish and Polish). If you want to contribute translating it,
you will be very welcome, so thank you in advance. Just follow the normal github process (fork the repository, etc.). And
if you don't know how to do it, there is no problem. In that case you can download all, translate it and then send it 
back to me directly. Or just contact me and I can send you the files.

If you have any doubt, concern, or there are texts that are not clear, do not hesitate and write me, or alternatively
create an issue in the repository.

## A couple of comments

* The release notes files are long, and they are growing. There are entries that correspond with versions from 2018. 
Because of that, I would say that you don't need to translate them completely. For instance, translating the latest ones
would be enough.
* Since adding (or updating) the translations is a change, I would like to ask you also for a translation of 
a thank-you sentence to be included in the release notes. I am always grateful to these contributions, so the sentence
could be something like: "*Translated to (language) by (name, alias,... what you prefer). Thank you very much your willingness
to collaborate*". Adding this to the release notes is the least I can do to thank you for helping the project this way.
